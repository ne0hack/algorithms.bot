# Algorithms Bot

## Overview
I am a fan of algorithms and an anti-fan of a huge number of accounts, which is why I decided to create this bot.\
The bot allows you to synchronize your assets of solved algorithms on GitHub with unsolved ones from LeetCode.

## Environments
The project can be built using docker via Dockerfile. Need the following envs:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<telegram bot token from @BotFather>
ADMIN_ID=<your user telegram id>
```
